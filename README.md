### About the Raspberry Pi

This project is built for the Raspberry Pi 3.

#### Raspberry Pi Power Levels

The Raspberry Pi provides general purpose digital input/output pins (called GPIO pins) that you can use for reading digital logic signals or for outputting digital logic levels. The outputs do not have much current capability, but you can drive LEDs or other low current devices. Of course to use them effectively and safely, you need to know their voltage levels and drive capability, and unfortunately, the RPi vendors don't supply the GPIO pin specs.
